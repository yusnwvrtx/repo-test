        <p>Alekei, because when he was a cub he remind me of Alex the Lion from Madagascar while he was still in Africa. He's the oldest and the most loving one <3.</p>

        <p>Belatrix. No, I don't like Harry Potter, she's named after the third brightest star in the Orion constellation. Because her eyes gleam like stars when she's in the dark. (poetical I know).</p>

        <p>Darwin. Because of Charles Darwin, although he's not the brightest ':D, because he looks really judging sometimes, like he's studying me.</p>

        <p>Some of my favorite games, feel free to add me and call me (if I'm online)!</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Genshin Impact</h3>
        <p>My UID is 646163104 and my favorite characters are Cyno and Furina, although the game has been underwhelming and tiring for me, it was a big love for me during three years, so I still hold some dear memories on it.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Sky Children of Light</h3>
        <p>Honestly, I only play it with my friends because I love exploring and chatting with them in the game. It's super cozy and fun, and the animations are superb, I absolutely love hugging my online friennds through this game.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Project Sekai</h3>
        <p>I don't have a lot to say about this, I love rhythm games, I love music, I love Hatsune Miku and I absolutely suck in this game.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Honkai Star Rail</h3>
        <p>Another loved game, the story is amazing, I really enjoy turn based battles, and the game is really fun. Feel free to add me and use my Jingyuan ;) [UID: 600299291</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Stardew Valley</h3>
        <p>Okay, I started playing this game because my sister was so obsessed with it and I wanted to understand her love. I wasn't giving it a that much of a credit, but Oh. God. I love casual games, I love battles, I love games with a cozy and friendly atmosphere. This game is my obsession (and Haley too, thx)</p>

        <p>And that's the page, thank you for reading!</p>
